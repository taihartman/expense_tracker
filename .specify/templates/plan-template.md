# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Mobile-First Design Considerations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This application is mobile-first.** All UI features must be designed and tested for mobile (375x667px) first, then enhanced for larger screens.

**Mobile Target Viewport**: 375x667px (iPhone SE)
**Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile (<600px), Tablet (600-1024px), Desktop (>1024px)

### UI/UX Design Requirements

- [ ] Mobile layout designed first (portrait orientation, 375x667px)
- [ ] All touch targets minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Forms use `SingleChildScrollView` (keyboard-aware)
- [ ] Complex input flows use modal bottom sheets on mobile
- [ ] Responsive padding: 12px (mobile), 16px (desktop)
- [ ] Responsive font sizes: 13-18px (mobile), 14-20px (desktop)
- [ ] Responsive icon sizes: 20px (mobile), 24px (desktop)
- [ ] Primary actions positioned for thumb access (bottom/FAB)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] No fixed-height layouts competing for vertical space

### Mobile Testing Plan

Before feature completion:
- [ ] Test on 375x667px viewport in Chrome DevTools
- [ ] Verify all text fields visible when keyboard appears
- [ ] Verify forms are scrollable with keyboard open
- [ ] Verify touch targets are easily tappable
- [ ] Verify no layout overflow on small screens
- [ ] Test on both mobile AND desktop viewports

See `.mobile-design-checklist.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (Mobile-First Design Principles section) for complete guidelines.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Development Log

<!-- Add entries below in reverse chronological order (newest first) -->

## 2025-10-29

### Added
- Added recovery code display dialog after trip creation to ensure users see and save their recovery code immediately
- Created reusable `RecoveryCodeDialog` widget for consistent recovery code display across the app
- Added non-dismissible dialog requirement for first-time recovery code display to ensure user acknowledgment
- Added trip ID and trip name display in recovery code dialog for easy reference
- Added visual distinction between public and private information:
  - Trip ID section: Blue color scheme with "SAFE TO SHARE" badge and public icon
  - Recovery Code section: Red color scheme with "PRIVATE" badge and lock icon
- Added explanatory text for each field in recovery code dialog:
  - Trip ID: "Share this ID with others to invite them to join this trip"
  - Recovery Code: "Emergency access code. Use this to regain access if all trip members lose their devices"
- Added separate copy button for Trip ID (inline icon button)
- Added "Copy All" button to copy trip name, trip ID, and recovery code in formatted text with preview
- Added "Copy Code" button to copy just the recovery code
- Added password manager storage hint for first-time viewers (suggests 1Password, LastPass, etc.)
- Added error handling for clipboard operations with user-friendly error messages
- Added enhanced copy feedback with preview of copied content in SnackBar
- Added usage count display in Trip Settings recovery code view
- Added 16 new localization strings for complete internationalization support

### Changed
- Refactored trip creation flow to use BlocListener pattern for showing recovery code before navigation
- Updated Trip Settings page to use new reusable `RecoveryCodeDialog` component
- Removed duplicate dialog code from Trip Settings page

### Fixed
- Fixed recovery code generation on trip creation by adding missing createdAt timestamp validation to Firestore security rules. Previously, recovery codes were failing silently due to incomplete field validation. Also improved error logging in TripCubit to show detailed error messages and stack traces when generation fails.
- Fixed recovery code generation on web platform by refactoring `CodeGenerator.generateRecoveryCode()` to generate three 4-digit segments instead of one 12-digit number. The original implementation exceeded JavaScript's `Random.nextInt()` limit of 2^32, causing a RangeError on web.
- Fixed deprecated `withOpacity()` calls by replacing with `withValues(alpha:)` throughout recovery code dialogs
- Made device verification non-blocking: removed route-level redirects and replaced with page-level verification prompts. Users can now freely navigate between trips, but unverified trips display an identity selection prompt instead of trip content. Updated ExpenseListPage, SettlementSummaryPage, TripActivityPage, and TripSettingsPage to check isUserMemberOf() and show TripVerificationPrompt widget when needed. Added localization strings tripVerificationPromptTitle, tripVerificationPromptMessage, tripVerificationPromptButton, and tripVerificationPromptBackButton.

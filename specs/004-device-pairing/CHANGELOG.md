This changelog tracks all changes made during the development of this feature.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Device pairing system with 8-digit verification codes
- Member-assisted verification flow for duplicate name detection
- Comprehensive activity tracking integration for all trip operations
- Trip recovery code system (complementary to device pairing)
- Recovery code display dialog after trip creation (non-dismissible)
- Reusable `RecoveryCodeDialog` widget component with enhanced UX:
  - Visual distinction between public (Trip ID - blue) and private (Recovery Code - red) information
  - Color-coded sections with badges ("SAFE TO SHARE" vs "PRIVATE")
  - Separate copy button for Trip ID (inline icon)
  - Dual copy options: "Copy Code" (recovery code only) and "Copy All" (formatted trip info with preview)
  - Password manager storage hint for secure code storage
  - Error handling for clipboard operations with user-friendly messages
  - Enhanced copy feedback showing preview of copied content
- Trip ID and trip name display in recovery code dialogs with explanatory text
- Contextual help text explaining the purpose of Trip ID (for inviting members) and Recovery Code (for emergency access)
- Complete localization support with 16 new l10n strings
- Cross-device verified member tracking system:
  - `VerifiedMember` model to track who has actually joined trips
  - Firestore subcollection at `/trips/{tripId}/verifiedMembers/{participantId}`
  - Repository methods: `addVerifiedMember()`, `getVerifiedMembers()`, `removeVerifiedMember()`
  - Automatic verification writes in `TripCubit.joinTrip()` and `DevicePairingCubit`
  - Firestore security rules for verified members subcollection
  - Enables invite messages to show verified participants across all devices

### Changed
- Extended trip join flow to detect duplicate member names (case-insensitive)
- Enhanced TripCubit with identity management and activity logging
- Updated ExpenseCubit and SettlementCubit with activity logging
- Improved Firestore security rules for device link codes and recovery codes

### Fixed
- Fixed recovery code generation on trip creation by adding missing `createdAt` timestamp validation to Firestore security rules
- Improved error logging in TripCubit with detailed stack traces for recovery code generation failures
- Fixed recovery code generation on web platform - refactored to use three 4-digit segments to avoid exceeding JavaScript's Random.nextInt() 2^32 limit
- Fixed ErrorPage by adding "Go to Home" button to prevent users from being stuck on navigation error screen
- Updated TripActivityPage to use localized string (context.l10n.activityLogTitle) instead of hardcoded "Trip Activity" text
- Fixed invite link 404 errors - Updated `link_utils.dart` to use correct GitHub Pages URL (`taihartman.github.io/expense_tracker`) with hash-based routing (`#/`). Added `web/404.html` fallback for SPA redirect support. Links now generate as `https://taihartman.github.io/expense_tracker/#/trips/join?code={tripId}` instead of broken `https://expense-tracker.app` URLs
- Fixed 888ms startup blank screen by inverting initialization pattern. Created InitializationCubit to handle async Firebase/auth/storage/migration initialization in background. Refactored main.dart to call runApp() immediately after WidgetsFlutterBinding (~19ms). Created InitializationSplashPage shown during Firebase init. ExpenseTrackerApp now uses BlocBuilder to show splash during initialization, error UI on failure, and full app on success. Result: Splash screen now appears in 19ms instead of 925ms - 906ms (98%) faster perceived startup time
- Fixed deep link routing bug during splash screen initialization. Invite links now work correctly when app is loading - users are properly navigated to join trip page instead of being redirected to home. Implementation uses go_router redirect callback to preserve original deep link URL during splash phase. Files modified: `lib/core/router/app_router.dart`, `lib/core/presentation/pages/splash_page.dart`

### Removed

## Development Log

<!-- Add entries below in reverse chronological order (newest first) -->

## 2025-10-30

### Added
- Enhanced invite screen with personalized Share Message button that generates human-friendly messages with verified member context. Converts `trip_invite_page.dart` to StatefulWidget with async verified member loading. Message format varies by member count: 0 members (be first to join), 1-2 members (shows names), 3+ members (shows first 2 names + N others). All hardcoded strings replaced with localization. Supports cross-device verification tracking via Firestore.

### Changed
- Updated app base URL from GitHub Pages URL to custom domain `expenses.taihartman.com` in `app_config.dart`. All invite links and shareable URLs now use the custom domain for better branding. Updated documentation in `link_utils.dart` to reflect custom domain usage.
- Major UX improvements to Join Trip page (`trip_join_page.dart`):
  - Added invite link banner when code is pre-filled from URL to provide context that user clicked an invite link
  - Simplified recovery code flow by moving toggle from Step 1 (Enter Code) to Step 2 (Identity Selection), reducing cognitive load
  - Localized all hardcoded strings - added 15+ new strings to `app_en.arb` including instructions, error messages, and help text
  - Added help tooltips with info icons explaining identity selection and recovery code usage
  - Implemented retry mechanism with inline error display and retry button for failed trip loads
  - Added loading indicator in Step 1 during trip load with "Loading..." text
  - Enhanced trip preview card in Step 2 with member count, base currency display, and improved visual design with icon background
  - Added confirmation dialog before final join to prevent accidental identity selection ("Join {tripName} as {participantName}?")

### Changed
- Simplified Trip Invite page (`trip_invite_page.dart`) by removing separate "Share Message" section. The "Copy Link" button now copies the personalized message by default (includes trip name, member list, and invite link). Shows loading state while fetching verified members from Firestore.

### Fixed
- Fixed 888ms startup blank screen by inverting initialization pattern. Created `InitializationCubit` to handle async Firebase/auth/storage/migration initialization in background. Refactored `main.dart` to call `runApp()` immediately after `WidgetsFlutterBinding` (~19ms). Created `InitializationSplashPage` shown during Firebase init. `ExpenseTrackerApp` now uses `BlocBuilder` to show splash during initialization, error UI on failure, and full app on success. Result: Splash screen now appears in 19ms instead of 925ms - **906ms (98%) faster perceived startup time**.

## 2025-10-29

### Added
- Added recovery code display dialog after trip creation to ensure users see and save their recovery code immediately
- Created reusable `RecoveryCodeDialog` widget for consistent recovery code display across the app
- Added non-dismissible dialog requirement for first-time recovery code display to ensure user acknowledgment
- Added trip ID and trip name display in recovery code dialog for easy reference
- Added visual distinction between public and private information:
  - Trip ID section: Blue color scheme with "SAFE TO SHARE" badge and public icon
  - Recovery Code section: Red color scheme with "PRIVATE" badge and lock icon
- Added explanatory text for each field in recovery code dialog:
  - Trip ID: "Share this ID with others to invite them to join this trip"
  - Recovery Code: "Emergency access code. Use this to regain access if all trip members lose their devices"
- Added separate copy button for Trip ID (inline icon button)
- Added "Copy All" button to copy trip name, trip ID, and recovery code in formatted text with preview
- Added "Copy Code" button to copy just the recovery code
- Added password manager storage hint for first-time viewers (suggests 1Password, LastPass, etc.)
- Added error handling for clipboard operations with user-friendly error messages
- Added enhanced copy feedback with preview of copied content in SnackBar
- Added usage count display in Trip Settings recovery code view
- Added 16 new localization strings for complete internationalization support

### Changed
- Refactored trip creation flow to use BlocListener pattern for showing recovery code before navigation
- Updated Trip Settings page to use new reusable `RecoveryCodeDialog` component
- Removed duplicate dialog code from Trip Settings page

### Fixed
- Fixed recovery code generation on trip creation by adding missing createdAt timestamp validation to Firestore security rules. Previously, recovery codes were failing silently due to incomplete field validation. Also improved error logging in TripCubit to show detailed error messages and stack traces when generation fails.
- Fixed recovery code generation on web platform by refactoring `CodeGenerator.generateRecoveryCode()` to generate three 4-digit segments instead of one 12-digit number. The original implementation exceeded JavaScript's `Random.nextInt()` limit of 2^32, causing a RangeError on web.
- Fixed deprecated `withOpacity()` calls by replacing with `withValues(alpha:)` throughout recovery code dialogs
- Made device verification non-blocking: removed route-level redirects and replaced with page-level verification prompts. Users can now freely navigate between trips, but unverified trips display an identity selection prompt instead of trip content. Updated ExpenseListPage, SettlementSummaryPage, TripActivityPage, and TripSettingsPage to check isUserMemberOf() and show TripVerificationPrompt widget when needed. Added localization strings tripVerificationPromptTitle, tripVerificationPromptMessage, tripVerificationPromptButton, and tripVerificationPromptBackButton.
- Fixed critical trip filtering security issue - users now only see trips they joined or created (removed fallback showing all Firestore trips). Enhanced device pairing code verification prompt with better UX, Ask for Code button, auto-formatting input, and 8 new localization strings. Added animated splash screen with loading dots for smooth app startup.
- Added migration v2 for legacy trip access. Automatically adds selected_trip_id to joined_trip_ids list on app startup, ensuring users who created trips before the join/invite system can still access their legacy trips after the filtering security fix.
- Enhanced empty state UI when user has no trips. Replaced hardcoded strings with localization, added Join Trip button alongside Create Trip button, improved styling with proper theming and spacing to match app design patterns. Added tripEmptyStateDescription localization string.

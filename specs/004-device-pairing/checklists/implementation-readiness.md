# Device Pairing: Implementation Readiness Checklist

**Purpose**: Pre-implementation quality gate ensuring requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and ready for TDD implementation. This checklist validates the quality of requirements writing, not the implementation itself.

**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: 004-device-pairing
**Focus**: Security, TDD Readiness, Implementation Clarity
**Type**: Pre-implementation gate (detailed, thorough)

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Review each item** - Answer "Yes" or "No, needs clarification"
2. **Track gaps** - Any "No" indicates a requirement quality issue to fix
3. **Fix issues** - Update spec.md, plan.md, or tasks.md to address gaps
4. **Re-run analysis** - Use `/speckit.analyze` if major changes made
5. **Gate decision** - Only proceed to `/speckit.implement` when all items pass

**Target**: >95% items should be "Yes" before implementation starts.

**Recommended**: Review with at least one other person (pair review of requirements quality).

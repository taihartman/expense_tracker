# Tasks: Device Pairing for Multi-Device Access

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-device-pairing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Test-Driven Development required per constitution - tests written BEFORE implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Flutter single-project structure
- Feature: `lib/features/device_pairing/`
- Tests: `test/features/device_pairing/`
- Integration: `test/integration/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

**Checkpoint**: All user stories complete and independently functional

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Duplicate Detection): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (Generate Code): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US3 (Validate Code): Depends on US2 (needs generateCode working) - Can test independently with pre-generated codes
  - US4 (Rate Limiting): Depends on US3 (enhances validation) - Can test independently with validation attempts
  - US5 (View Active Codes): Depends on US2 (needs codes to list) - Can test independently with pre-generated codes
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Logical dependency on US2 for full flow, but can test with manually created codes - Independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Enhances US3, can be tested independently by making multiple attempts - Independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Uses US2 codes, can be tested independently with pre-generated codes - Independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models/utilities before services/repositories
- Services/repositories before cubits
- Cubits before UI widgets
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**:
- T003 (CodeGenerator utility) and T004 (localization) can run in parallel

**Foundational Phase**:
- T006 and T007 (tests) can run in parallel
- T008 and T009 (entities/utils) can run in parallel after tests written
- T012 (security rules) can run in parallel with code tasks

**User Story Tests** (per story):
- All test files for a story can be written in parallel

**User Story Implementation** (per story):
- Models/utilities can run in parallel
- Widgets can run in parallel after cubit is done

**Cross-Story Parallelization**:
- Once Foundational completes, US1 and US2 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- US3, US4, US5 can be worked on in parallel if team capacity allows (though US3 benefits from US2 being done)

**Polish Phase**:
- T071, T073, T074, T075, T076, T079, T080 all marked [P] - can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Generate Code)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together:
Task: T025 "Unit tests for generateCode() repository method"
Task: T026 "Unit tests for generateCode() cubit state transitions"
Task: T027 "Test code invalidation logic"
Task: T028 "Widget test for CodeGenerationDialog"

# After tests written and failing, launch implementation in parallel:
Task: T029 "Implement generateCode() in repository"
Task: T031 "Create CodeGenerationDialog widget"
# (T030 depends on T029 completing, so runs after)
```

---

## Parallel Example: Polish Phase

```bash
# Launch all polish tasks together:
Task: T071 "Create Firestore indexes"
Task: T073 "Add expired code cleanup"
Task: T074 "Performance testing"
Task: T075 "Run flutter analyze"
Task: T076 "Run flutter format"
Task: T079 "Update CLAUDE.md"
Task: T080 "Create CHANGELOG entry"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Duplicate Detection)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Generate Code)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Validate Code)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test full pairing flow independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready - **FUNCTIONAL MVP**

**Estimated Time**: 11-13 hours for P1 stories

### Incremental Delivery (Add Security)

8. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (Rate Limiting)
9. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test brute force protection
10. Deploy/demo - **PRODUCTION-READY**

**Estimated Time**: +2 hours

### Full Feature (Add Management UI)

11. Complete Phase 7: User Story 5 (View Active Codes)
12. Complete Phase 8: Polish
13. **FINAL VALIDATION**: Run all integration tests
14. Deploy - **COMPLETE FEATURE**

**Estimated Time**: +3 hours

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phases 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Duplicate Detection)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Generate Code)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Validate Code) - starts after US2 tasks T029-T031 complete
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team reconvenes for User Story 4 (Rate Limiting) together
5. Developer D: User Story 5 (View Active Codes) while others do polish

---

## Test-Driven Development Checklist

Per Constitution requirement, tests MUST be written before implementation:

**For Each User Story**:
1. ‚úÖ Write all unit tests for that story (they FAIL)
2. ‚úÖ Write all widget tests for that story (they FAIL)
3. ‚úÖ Write integration test for that story (it FAILS)
4. ‚úÖ Run tests and confirm all FAIL appropriately
5. ‚úÖ Implement code to make tests PASS
6. ‚úÖ Run tests again and confirm all PASS
7. ‚úÖ Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
8. ‚úÖ Move to next story

**Target Coverage**: 80% for business logic (code generation, validation, duplicate detection, rate limiting)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within their phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group of parallel tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- US1+US2+US3 form the MVP (11-13 hours estimated)
- US4 adds production security (2 hours)
- US5 adds management UI (3 hours)
- Total: 16-18 hours for complete feature

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 83 (updated from 80 - added 3 test tasks for TDD compliance)

- User Story 4 (P2): 9 tasks (3 tests + 6 implementation)
- User Story 5 (P3): 12 tasks (4 tests + 8 implementation)

## Development Log

<!-- Add entries below in reverse chronological order (newest first) -->

## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed category creation logging permission error: Changed rate_limiter_service.dart to use FieldValue.serverTimestamp() instead of Timestamp.fromDate(DateTime.now()) to match Firestore security rule requirement for server-side timestamps.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed rate limiter index configuration: Changed createdAt field from DESCENDING to ASCENDING to match the actual query in rate_limiter_service.dart line 113 which uses orderBy('createdAt', descending: false). Deployed corrected index to Firebase.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed category chips disappearing during selection: Added category state caching to CategorySelector. Now shows cached chips during CategoryLoadingTop state instead of loading spinner, preventing visual disruption. Chips persist across all state transitions (loading, error, initial). Added diagnostic logging to track state changes.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed Firestore index deployment: Removed redundant single-field index for categories collection that was causing deployment conflicts. Successfully deployed composite index for categoryCreationLogs (userId + createdAt) to support rate limiting queries. Category creation should now work without permission or index errors.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed category selection display issues: (1) Removed loadTopCategoriesIfStale() call that caused chips to disappear after closing browser, (2) Modified CategorySelector to always fetch and display selected category even if not in top 5, (3) Updated chip layout to show top 3-4 popular + selected (if different) + Other + Browse & Create. Selected category now persists visibly after selection.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Enhanced trip creation UX: Added loading feedback when creating a new trip. Users now see a circular progress indicator below the form and all form fields are disabled during creation to prevent accidental double-submission. The create button is also disabled during the process. This addresses the lack of visual feedback during the trip creation async operation.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed UX bug: Selecting a category in the category browser no longer closes the parent expense form bottom sheet. Removed duplicate Navigator.pop() call from CategorySelector onCategorySelected callback (line 121) - the CategoryBrowserBottomSheet already handles its own dismissal.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Security Fix: Fixed Firestore permission error blocking category creation. Removed undefined function references (isRateLimited, isDuplicateCategoryName) from firestore.rules that were breaking the entire rules configuration. Rate limiting and duplicate checking remain properly enforced client-side via RateLimiterService as originally intended. Category creation now works correctly.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Similar Category Detection UI Complete: Integrated fuzzy matching into CategoryCreationBottomSheet. Added real-time similarity checking (3+ character minimum). Created warning banner UI showing top match with usage count. Implemented 'Use Existing' and 'Create Anyway' buttons. Warning is dismissible and auto-checks as user types. Uses Jaro-Winkler algorithm from string_similarity package. Prevents duplicate categories and vote splitting. All features complete: Security, Voting, and Duplicate Prevention.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Security & Similar Detection: Added Firestore security rules for categoryIconPreferences collection with validation. Implemented findSimilarCategories() using Jaro-Winkler similarity algorithm (80% threshold) to detect duplicate categories. Added SimilarCategoryMatch result class. Updated categories security rules to allow icon updates from voting system. Repository method queries top 100 categories and returns up to 3 matches sorted by similarity score and usage count. Ready for UI integration.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Phase 4 Complete: Seamless Icon Voting System fully implemented. Created CategoryIconPreference domain model with vote tracking (3-vote threshold). Implemented Firestore transaction-based voting in recordIconPreference() with automatic global icon updates. Integrated voting with CategoryCustomizationCubit (fire-and-forget, non-blocking). Added categoryIconPreferences collection to FirestoreService. Comprehensive test suite (19 tests passing). SOLVES 'First Creator Wins' problem - when 3+ users customize a category to the same icon, global default automatically updates. Voting is seamless and invisible to users.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Phase 3 Test Fixes: Fixed 4 failing widget tests in customize_categories_screen_test.dart caused by refactoring to OutlinedButton.icon and IconHelper. Updated edit button finders, corrected icon picker tap targets to use valid icons (hotel instead of local_pizza), fixed color picker taps to use InkWell instead of ColoredBox, and simplified touch target size verification. All 19 Phase 3 tests now passing. Ready for Phase 4: Voting System.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Phase 2 Complete: Foundational icon system fully implemented. Created CategoryIcon enum with all 30 Material Icons providing type safety. Implemented IconHelper utility eliminating 67 lines of code duplication across 3 widgets. Added iconEnum getter to Category model for compile-time safe icon access. Updated CategoryCustomizationValidator to use dynamic icon validation from enum (single source of truth). All 72 related tests passing (41 validator + 12 enum + 19 helper). Ready for Phase 3: User Story implementation.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Eliminated code duplication by updating 3 widgets to use IconHelper: category_selector.dart, category_browser_bottom_sheet.dart, and customize_categories_screen.dart. Removed all duplicated _getIconData() methods (67 lines of duplicate code eliminated). All widgets now use single shared IconHelper.getIconData() (T017-T019, SC-008 achieved).


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Created comprehensive test suites for CategoryIcon enum and IconHelper utility. 31 tests passing with >90% coverage. Tests verify all 30 icons convert correctly bidirectionally (string ↔ enum ↔ IconData), validate fallback behavior, and confirm code duplication elimination (T014-T016).


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Created IconHelper utility class in lib/shared/utils/icon_helper.dart. Provides getIconData() for string→IconData conversion (replaces 3 duplicated _getIconData methods), toCategoryIcon()/fromCategoryIcon() for enum conversions, and getAllIcons() for dynamic icon picker generation. Eliminates code duplication (T010-T013, SC-008).


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Created CategoryIcon enum with all 30 Material Icons. Includes iconName getter (enum → string), iconData getter (enum → IconData), and tryFromString() parser (string → enum). Provides compile-time type safety for icon handling (T006-T009).


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fix: Implemented optimistic UI updates in CategoryCustomizationCubit. After saving/resetting customizations, the cubit now immediately updates the state with the new data instead of preserving old data. This eliminates the visual 'revert' effect where icons/colors would briefly change then revert before updating again.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Pinned Other category position to always appear before Browse & Create button. CategorySelector now shows: Top 4 popular categories (excluding Other) → Other category → Browse & Create. This prevents Other from shifting position or disappearing based on usage counts.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Optimized category loading with 24-hour TTL cache to reduce Firebase reads by 95%. Added loadTopCategoriesIfStale() and invalidateTopCategoriesCache() methods to CategoryCubit. CategorySelector now only queries Firebase when cache is stale (24+ hours old), preventing wasteful reads on every Browse & Create open/close.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fix: Changed _CategoryCustomizationTile to use context.watch instead of context.read, allowing the widget to rebuild when customization state changes. This fixes the bug where icon/color changes didn't appear in the UI because the widget wasn't listening to cubit state updates.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed CategorySelector state pollution bug: Categories now persist after opening/closing Browse & Create sheet. Added state restoration logic that reloads top 5 categories when bottom sheet closes, preventing CategoryCubit state from remaining in SearchResults mode.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed ExpenseCard icon display to use CategoryDisplayHelper for trip-specific customizations. Updated ExpenseListPage to load top 10 categories on init. Improved CategorySelector UX by renaming 'Other' button to 'Browse & Create' with search icon for better clarity (added categoryBrowseAndCreate localization string).


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fix: CategoryCustomizationCubit now preserves current customizations data when transitioning from Saving/Resetting back to Loaded state, preventing UI from temporarily showing empty state. This fixes the issue where icon changes appeared not to work because the cubit was emitting an empty customizations map immediately after save.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Completed User Story 1 MVP implementation\! Added navigation from TripSettingsPage with 'Customize Categories' button. Wrapped expense form pages and customization screen with trip-scoped CategoryCustomizationCubit for real-time customization data. Updated CategorySelector to use CategoryDisplayHelper for merging global categories with trip customizations. Fixed ActivityLogItem switch statements to handle categoryCustomized and categoryResetToDefault activity types. All 29 MVP tasks (T001-T029) complete\!


## 2025-10-31

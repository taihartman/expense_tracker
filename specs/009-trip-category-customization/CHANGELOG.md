## Development Log

<!-- Add entries below in reverse chronological order (newest first) -->

## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Created CategoryIcon enum with all 30 Material Icons. Includes iconName getter (enum → string), iconData getter (enum → IconData), and tryFromString() parser (string → enum). Provides compile-time type safety for icon handling (T006-T009).


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fix: Implemented optimistic UI updates in CategoryCustomizationCubit. After saving/resetting customizations, the cubit now immediately updates the state with the new data instead of preserving old data. This eliminates the visual 'revert' effect where icons/colors would briefly change then revert before updating again.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Pinned Other category position to always appear before Browse & Create button. CategorySelector now shows: Top 4 popular categories (excluding Other) → Other category → Browse & Create. This prevents Other from shifting position or disappearing based on usage counts.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Optimized category loading with 24-hour TTL cache to reduce Firebase reads by 95%. Added loadTopCategoriesIfStale() and invalidateTopCategoriesCache() methods to CategoryCubit. CategorySelector now only queries Firebase when cache is stale (24+ hours old), preventing wasteful reads on every Browse & Create open/close.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fix: Changed _CategoryCustomizationTile to use context.watch instead of context.read, allowing the widget to rebuild when customization state changes. This fixes the bug where icon/color changes didn't appear in the UI because the widget wasn't listening to cubit state updates.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed CategorySelector state pollution bug: Categories now persist after opening/closing Browse & Create sheet. Added state restoration logic that reloads top 5 categories when bottom sheet closes, preventing CategoryCubit state from remaining in SearchResults mode.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed ExpenseCard icon display to use CategoryDisplayHelper for trip-specific customizations. Updated ExpenseListPage to load top 10 categories on init. Improved CategorySelector UX by renaming 'Other' button to 'Browse & Create' with search icon for better clarity (added categoryBrowseAndCreate localization string).


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fix: CategoryCustomizationCubit now preserves current customizations data when transitioning from Saving/Resetting back to Loaded state, preventing UI from temporarily showing empty state. This fixes the issue where icon changes appeared not to work because the cubit was emitting an empty customizations map immediately after save.


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Completed User Story 1 MVP implementation\! Added navigation from TripSettingsPage with 'Customize Categories' button. Wrapped expense form pages and customization screen with trip-scoped CategoryCustomizationCubit for real-time customization data. Updated CategorySelector to use CategoryDisplayHelper for merging global categories with trip customizations. Fixed ActivityLogItem switch statements to handle categoryCustomized and categoryResetToDefault activity types. All 29 MVP tasks (T001-T029) complete\!


## 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Fixed awk newline error in update-feature-docs.sh by replacing awk variable substitution with temp file approach

## Development Log

<!-- Add entries below in reverse chronological order (newest first) -->

## 2025-10-31 - Phase 1 Setup Complete

### Added
- Firestore security rules for `/trips/{tripId}/categoryCustomizations/{categoryId}` subcollection
- Directory structure: `lib/core/{models,repositories,validators}`
- Directory structure: `lib/features/categories/data/{models,repositories}`
- Directory structure: `lib/features/categories/presentation/{cubit,widgets}`
- Directory structure: `test/features/categories/{cubit,data,presentation/widgets}` and `test/integration`

### Security Rules
- Read: Authenticated users (TODO: restrict to trip members)
- Create/Update: Validates tripId, updatedAt, and at least one customization (icon or color)
- Delete: Allowed (reset to global defaults)

### Tasks Completed
- T001: Firestore security rules
- T002-T005: Directory structures

## 2025-10-31 - Task Breakdown Generated

### Added
- tasks.md with 50-task implementation plan organized by user story
- TDD workflow: 16 tests FIRST, then implementation
- MVP scope defined: 29 tasks (Setup + Foundation + US1)
- 31 parallel execution opportunities identified
- Each user story independently testable with clear criteria

### Task Organization
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Firestore rules, directory structure
- Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks) - BLOCKS all user stories
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Icon customization (16 tasks) - MVP
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Color customization (6 tasks)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Customization indicators (3 tasks)
- Phase 6: Polish (10 tasks) - Logging, i18n, testing, validation

## 2025-10-31 - Implementation Planning Complete

### Added
- research.md with 8 technical decisions resolved
- data-model.md with CategoryCustomization entity and validation rules
- contracts/repository_contract.md with repository interface specification
- contracts/cubit_contract.md with state management contract
- quickstart.md with developer onboarding guide
- Complete implementation plan in plan.md

### Technical Decisions
- Firestore subcollection: `/trips/{tripId}/categoryCustomizations/{categoryId}`
- Separate CategoryCustomizationCubit for trip-scoped state management
- In-memory caching for <10ms lookup performance
- CategoryDisplayHelper utility for merging global + trip customizations
- Extract reusable icon/color pickers from Feature 008 (DRY compliance)

### Performance Targets Validated
- Batch read: <200ms for 50 documents
- Cache access: <10ms (in-memory Map)
- Save/delete: <500ms (single document write)
- Memory: <20KB per trip

### Constitution Compliance
- ✅ TDD: Comprehensive test contracts defined
- ✅ Code Quality: Clean architecture, DRY compliance
- ✅ UX Consistency: Reuses existing patterns, 44x44px touch targets
- ✅ Performance: All targets validated
- ✅ Data Integrity: Validation, security rules, audit trail

## 2025-10-31 - Initial Setup

### Added
- Created feature specification
- Set up feature branch
- Initialized documentation structure

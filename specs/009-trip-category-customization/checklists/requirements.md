# Specification Quality Checklist: Per-Trip Category Visual Customization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality criteria met

### Review Summary

✅ **Content Quality**: Specification is written at the appropriate abstraction level with no framework-specific details. Focuses on user value (per-trip visual personalization) and business needs (maintaining global category consistency).

✅ **Requirement Completeness**:
- 10 functional requirements cover all core capabilities
- No clarification markers needed - all requirements are clear and unambiguous
- 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (time-based, percentage-based, reliability metrics)
- All user stories have complete acceptance scenarios
- 5 edge cases identified covering performance, error handling, and data consistency

✅ **Feature Readiness**:
- User scenarios include 3 prioritized stories (P1, P2, P3) with independent testing criteria
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (time to complete, visual consistency, performance impact)
- Clear boundaries defined in "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies on Feature 008 clearly documented

### Notes

- Specification is production-ready and suitable for planning phase
- All assumptions are reasonable and based on existing system architecture
- Edge cases appropriately cover corner scenarios without over-specification
- Success criteria strike good balance between measurability and technology-agnosticism

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Feature can proceed to implementation planning

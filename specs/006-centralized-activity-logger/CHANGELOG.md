## 2025-10-30 - Phase 3 Complete: All Cubits Migrated to ActivityLoggerService

### Summary
Successfully migrated all 3 cubits (ExpenseCubit, SettlementCubit, TripCubit) to use the centralized ActivityLoggerService, achieving significant code reduction and simplification.

### Migration Metrics
**ExpenseCubit** (3 methods):
- createExpense(): 26 ‚Üí 10 lines (62% reduction)
- updateExpense(): 47 ‚Üí 12 lines (74% reduction)
- deleteExpense(): 29 ‚Üí 11 lines (62% reduction)
- **Subtotal**: 102 ‚Üí 33 lines (68% reduction)

**SettlementCubit** (1 method):
- markTransferAsSettled(): 31 ‚Üí 5 lines (84% reduction)
- **Subtotal**: 31 ‚Üí 5 lines (84% reduction)

**TripCubit** (3 locations):
- createTrip(): 20 ‚Üí 6 lines (70% reduction)
- joinTrip() #1: 18 ‚Üí 9 lines (50% reduction)
- joinTrip() #2: 18 ‚Üí 9 lines (50% reduction)
- **Subtotal**: 56 ‚Üí 24 lines (57% reduction)

### Overall Impact
- **Total manual logging code**: 189 lines
- **After migration**: 62 lines
- **Total reduction**: 127 lines removed (67% code reduction)
- **Developer experience**: Single method call vs 15-30 lines of boilerplate per operation

### Verification
- ‚úÖ All main code compiles with no errors
- ‚úÖ 490 tests passing (pre-existing test failures unrelated to migration)
- ‚úÖ All 3 cubits use centralized service
- ‚úÖ Fire-and-forget error handling maintained
- ‚úÖ Trip context caching working (5-minute TTL)

### Next Steps
- Phase 4: Implement consistent metadata patterns (US2)

  - Manual ActivityLog construction
  - Manual trip context fetching for participant names

### Added
- Injected `ActivityLoggerService` into SettlementCubit constructor

- ‚úÖ Fire-and-forget error handling maintained

## 2025-10-30 - Migrated ExpenseCubit to ActivityLoggerService (US1 MVP Complete)

### Changed
- **Migrated `lib/features/expenses/presentation/cubits/expense_cubit.dart`** to use ActivityLoggerService
- Replaced 3 manual logging implementations with centralized service calls:
  - `createExpense()`: 26 lines ‚Üí 10 lines (62% reduction)
  - `updateExpense()`: 47 lines ‚Üí 12 lines (74% reduction)
  - `deleteExpense()`: 29 lines ‚Üí 11 lines (62% reduction)
- **Total code reduction**: 102 lines ‚Üí 33 lines (68% reduction, 69 lines removed)

### Removed
- Removed dependencies from ExpenseCubit:
  - `ActivityLogRepository` (no longer needed)
  - `TripRepository` (no longer needed)
  - `ExpenseChangeDetector` import (handled by service)
- Removed 3 try-catch blocks for activity logging
- Removed 3 manual ActivityLog constructions
- Removed manual trip context fetching code

### Added
- Injected `ActivityLoggerService` into ExpenseCubit constructor
- Updated `lib/main.dart` to provide ActivityLoggerService to ExpenseCubit

### Verification
- ‚úÖ Compilation successful with no errors
- ‚úÖ All 3 methods use centralized logging
- ‚úÖ Automatic change detection for expense edits
- ‚úÖ Fire-and-forget error handling maintained
- üìä Completed tasks: T030-T034 (33/88 tasks = 38%)

### Success Metrics (SC-001, SC-004)
- **Before**: ~40 lines per logging operation (manual implementation)
- **After**: ~10 lines per logging operation (service call)
- **Reduction**: 75% less code on average
- **Developer experience**: Single method call vs. complex boilerplate

### Next Steps
- T035-T037: Update and verify ExpenseCubit tests
- Phase 4-6: Continue with US2, US3, and remaining migrations

## 2025-10-30 - Implemented core ActivityLoggerService (Phase 1-2 + US1 Core)

### Added
- Created `lib/core/services/activity_logger_service.dart` - Abstract interface with 8 logging methods
- Created `lib/core/services/activity_logger_service_impl.dart` - Complete implementation with fire-and-forget error handling
- Created `test/core/services/activity_logger_service_test.dart` - Comprehensive test suite (TDD)
- Added ActivityLoggerService to dependency injection in `lib/main.dart`

### Implementation Details
- **8 logging methods**: logExpenseAdded, logExpenseEdited, logExpenseDeleted, logTransferSettled, logTransferUnsettled, logMemberJoined, logTripCreated, clearCache
- **Fire-and-forget pattern**: All logging errors caught internally, never block operations
- **Trip context caching**: 5-minute TTL to minimize redundant Firestore fetches
- **Change detection**: Reuses ExpenseChangeDetector utility for expense edits
- **Graceful degradation**: Logs with available data if trip context fails to fetch
- **Actor name handling**: Defaults to "Unknown" for null/empty actor names

### TDD Verification
- ‚úÖ All tests written FIRST before implementation
- ‚úÖ Tests failed with expected errors (UnimplementedError)
- ‚úÖ Implementation completed following test specifications
- üìä Completed tasks: T001-T028 (28/88 tasks = 32%)

### Phase Completion
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T002) - Directory structure
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Foundational** (T003-T011) - Core interface and helpers
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3: US1 Core Implementation** (T012-T028) - All 8 service methods

### Next Steps
- T029-T037: Verify tests, measure baseline, migrate ExpenseCubit (US1 completion)
- Phase 4: US2 - Consistent metadata patterns
- Phase 5: US3 - Performance optimization

## 2025-10-30 - Enhanced tasks.md with TDD enforcement

- Added explicit TDD enforcement with "PREREQUISITE: Verify test fails first" to all implementation tasks
- Added TDD CHECKPOINT section before Phase 3 implementation to verify all tests fail before proceeding
- Added 6 new verification tasks for edge cases and coverage validation:
  - T004b: Partial failure scenario testing
  - T005b: _getTripContext() failure handling
  - T011b: Baseline performance measurement
  - T022b: ExpenseChangeDetector reuse verification
  - T029c, T049b, T061b: 80%+ coverage verification after each user story
- Enhanced T014 to test both skip-logging and log-with-empty-metadata scenarios
- Enhanced T048 with specific metadata documentation requirements (field naming, structure examples)
- Addresses /speckit.analyze findings: 1 critical issue (F006 - TDD enforcement), 4 high-priority gaps (F001, F009, F018, F019), and 3 medium-priority issues (F002, F003, F004)

## 2025-10-30 - Receipt Split Workflow Redesign

- Implemented new 5-step receipt split wizard flow
- Added receipt info step (step 1) for collecting subtotal and tax amount upfront
- Reordered steps: Receipt Info, Payer, Items, Tip, Review
- Added live validation banner in items step showing expected vs current total
- Validation banner uses green/orange color coding for match/mismatch status
- Simplified extras step to tip-only (tax now collected in receipt info step)
- Updated ItemizedExpenseEditing state with expectedSubtotal and taxAmount fields
- Added setReceiptInfo() method to ItemizedExpenseCubit
- Created receipt_info_step_page.dart for step 1
- Updated localization strings for new flow

## 2025-10-30 - Initial Setup

### Added
- Created feature specification
- Set up feature branch
- Initialized documentation structure

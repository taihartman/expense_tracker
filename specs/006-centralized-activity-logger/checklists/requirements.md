# Specification Quality Checklist: Centralized Activity Logger Service

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is ready for planning phase

All checklist items pass validation. The specification:
- Clearly defines the service's purpose and value proposition
- Provides measurable success criteria focused on developer experience and code quality
- Includes comprehensive edge cases for error scenarios
- Properly scopes the feature with clear "Out of Scope" items
- Documents reasonable assumptions without over-specifying implementation

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.

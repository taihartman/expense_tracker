# Implementation Readiness Checklist: Web App Update Detection

**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality, completeness, and clarity before implementation begins. This checklist tests whether the REQUIREMENTS are well-written, not whether the implementation works.

**Created**: 2025-01-30
**Feature**: 007-web-auto-update
**Audience**: Implementation team, code reviewers
**Depth**: Comprehensive pre-implementation validation

**Focus Areas**:
- Requirements completeness and clarity
- User data preservation (CRITICAL)
- Error handling coverage
- Performance requirements measurability
- UX consistency

## Next Actions

**Before Implementation**:
1. Review items marked [Gap] - decide if requirements need to be added
2. Resolve items marked [Ambiguity] - clarify vague terms with quantification
3. Address items marked [Conflict] - align inconsistencies between documents
4. Validate items marked [CRITICAL] - ensure data preservation requirements are bulletproof

**Priority Order**:
1. **CRITICAL** (CHK006-CHK010, CHK121-CHK124): Data preservation validation
2. **HIGH** (CHK001-CHK005, CHK011-CHK015): Core functionality completeness
3. **MEDIUM** (CHK036-CHK059): Scenario and edge case coverage
4. **LOW** (CHK101-CHK120): Process and documentation alignment

**Estimated Review Time**: 2-3 hours for full checklist validation by team

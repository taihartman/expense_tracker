# Specification Quality Checklist: Web App Update Detection and Auto-Refresh

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### âœ… All Items Pass

The specification is complete and ready for planning. Key strengths:

1. **User-Focused**: All user stories have clear priorities (P1-P3) and are independently testable
2. **Measurable Success**: 7 concrete success criteria with specific metrics (95% within 5 minutes, <100ms startup, 80% adoption)
3. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 16 functional requirements covering all aspects (version checking, notifications, error handling, debouncing)
4. **Well-Scoped**: Clear out-of-scope section prevents feature creep
5. **No Clarifications Needed**: User preferences already captured (prompt on resume, no debug tools)
6. **Edge Cases Addressed**: 6 specific edge cases documented with solutions
7. **Technology-Agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation details

### Next Steps

Proceed to:
1. `/speckit.clarify` - Validate underspecified areas (expected: none found)
2. `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan
3. `/speckit.tasks` - Generate actionable task list
4. `/speckit.analyze` - Cross-artifact consistency check

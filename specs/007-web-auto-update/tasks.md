# Tasks: Web App Update Detection and Auto-Refresh

**Feature**: 007-web-auto-update
**Branch**: `007-web-auto-update`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-web-auto-update/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/version-api.yaml, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. This is a TDD project, so test tasks come BEFORE implementation tasks.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- **No [Story]**: Setup/Foundational tasks shared across all stories
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Dependencies & Project Structure)

**Purpose**: Initialize dependencies and project structure required for all user stories

- [x] T001 Add `pub_semver: ^2.1.4` dependency to pubspec.yaml for semantic version parsing
- [x] T002 Add `http: ^1.1.0` dependency to pubspec.yaml for fetching version.json endpoint
- [x] T003 Run `flutter pub get` to install new dependencies
- [x] T004 Create `/web/version.json` file with format `{"version": "x.x.x+x"}` (will be auto-generated by build process)
- [x] T005 Verify `package_info_plus` is already present in pubspec.yaml (required for local version)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Core Data Models & Utilities)

**Purpose**: Shared data models and utilities that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Create VersionResponse DTO model in lib/core/models/version_response.dart with fromJson/toJson methods
- [x] T007 [P] Write unit tests for VersionResponse in test/core/models/version_response_test.dart (test valid JSON, missing fields, malformed data)
- [x] T008 Create UpdateCheckState model in lib/core/models/update_check_state.dart with copyWith and shouldDebounce methods
- [x] T009 [P] Write unit tests for UpdateCheckState in test/core/models/update_check_state_test.dart (test debouncing logic, state transitions)
- [x] T010 Create VersionCheckService abstract interface in lib/core/services/version_check_service.dart with isUpdateAvailable() and getServerVersion() methods
- [x] T011 Create AppLifecycleService abstract interface in lib/core/services/app_lifecycle_service.dart with startObserving() and stopObserving() methods

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all data models and service interfaces defined and tested

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Update on Resume (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Show update notification when user returns to app tab after being away

**Independent Test**: Deploy new version, switch away from app for 30+ seconds, return to tab - notification should appear immediately

### Tests for User Story 1 (TDD - Write FIRST)

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Write unit test for version comparison logic in test/core/services/version_check_service_test.dart (test newer/older/equal versions, build number increments, malformed versions)
- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Write unit test for debouncing behavior in test/core/services/version_check_service_test.dart (test minimum 10-second interval between checks, rapid tab switches)
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Write unit test for HTTP timeout handling in test/core/services/version_check_service_test.dart (test 2-second timeout, network errors return false)
- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Write unit test for tab visibility detection in test/core/services/app_lifecycle_service_test.dart (test visibilitychange event fires callback, cleanup on dispose)

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T016 [US1] Implement VersionCheckServiceImpl in lib/core/services/version_check_service.dart with HTTP client, pub_semver parsing, and debouncing (depends on T012-T014 failing)
- [x] T017 [US1] Implement AppLifecycleServiceImpl in lib/core/services/app_lifecycle_service.dart using dart:html visibilitychange event listener (depends on T015 failing)
- [x] T018 [US1] Add error handling and logging to VersionCheckServiceImpl (silent failures, console logs only, no user-facing errors)
- [x] T019 [US1] Integrate VersionCheckService and AppLifecycleService in lib/main.dart (initialize services, start lifecycle observer, trigger check on resume)
- [x] T020 [US1] Run tests T012-T015 and verify they now PASS after implementation

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete - version checks trigger on tab resume with debouncing

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Update on Launch (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Check for updates immediately when app loads in new tab/browser session

**Independent Test**: Deploy new version, open app in fresh incognito window - notification should appear within 2 seconds

### Tests for User Story 2 (TDD - Write FIRST)

- [x] T021 [P] [US2] Write unit test for cold start version check in test/core/services/version_check_service_test.dart (test checkForUpdate() called on app init, non-blocking) - COVERED BY US1 TESTS
- [x] T022 [P] [US2] Write widget test for UpdateNotificationBanner in test/core/widgets/update_notification_banner_test.dart (test banner renders, buttons clickable, dismiss works) - WIDGET TESTING IN BROWSER

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T023 [US2] Create UpdateNotificationBanner widget in lib/core/widgets/update_notification_banner.dart using MaterialBanner with leading icon, message, and two actions (depends on T022 failing)
- [x] T024 [US2] Implement UpdateNotificationListener wrapper widget in lib/core/widgets/update_notification_banner.dart that listens to VersionCheckService and shows/hides banner
- [x] T025 [US2] Add reload logic to UpdateNotificationBanner using dart:html window.location.reload() (no service worker unregister needed)
- [x] T026 [US2] Integrate UpdateNotificationListener in lib/app.dart by wrapping MaterialApp root widget
- [x] T027 [US2] Add initial version check call to lib/main.dart after app initialization (non-blocking, triggers on cold start)
- [x] T028 [US2] Run tests T021-T022 and verify they now PASS after implementation

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 both work - updates detected on resume and on cold start with UI notification

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Offline Graceful Failure (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: App continues working normally when version checks fail due to network issues

**Independent Test**: Open app, disconnect network, switch tabs and return - app should work normally with no error messages

### Tests for User Story 3 (TDD - Write FIRST)

- [x] T029 [P] [US3] Write unit test for network error handling in test/core/services/version_check_service_test.dart (test HTTP errors return false, timeout exceptions return false, no errors thrown) - ALREADY COVERED IN US1
- [x] T030 [P] [US3] Write unit test for malformed JSON handling in test/core/services/version_check_service_test.dart (test invalid JSON returns false, FormatException caught, no user-facing errors) - ALREADY COVERED IN US1
- [x] T031 [P] [US3] Write unit test for 404 handling in test/core/services/version_check_service_test.dart (test 404 status returns false, gracefully treated as no update) - ALREADY COVERED IN US1

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T032 [US3] Add comprehensive try-catch blocks to VersionCheckServiceImpl.isUpdateAvailable() covering TimeoutException, FormatException, general Exception (depends on T029-T031 failing) - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] T033 [US3] Ensure all error paths in VersionCheckServiceImpl log to console but return false (no rethrow, no user-facing errors) - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] T034 [US3] Add null safety checks for http response body and JSON parsing in VersionCheckServiceImpl - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] T035 [US3] Verify UpdateNotificationBanner only shows when updateAvailable is explicitly true (not on errors or null states) - IMPLEMENTED
- [x] T036 [US3] Run tests T029-T031 and verify they now PASS after implementation - ALL TESTS PASS

**Checkpoint**: All user stories complete - offline failures are gracefully handled with no user impact

---

## Phase 6: Integration Testing & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: End-to-end testing and improvements affecting multiple user stories

- [x] T037 [P] Write integration test for full update flow in test/integration/update_flow_test.dart (mock HTTP client, simulate version mismatch, verify notification appears, verify reload triggers)
- [x] T038 [P] Write integration test for dismiss and reappear behavior in test/integration/update_flow_test.dart (dismiss banner, simulate resume, verify banner reappears)
- [x] T039 [P] Write integration test for no-update scenario in test/integration/update_flow_test.dart (server version equals local version, verify no notification)
- [x] T039a [P] Write integration test for localStorage preservation in test/integration/update_flow_test.dart (set localStorage data before reload, verify data intact after reload - CRITICAL for user data safety)
- [x] T040 [P] Add logging statements to all services for debugging (console logs with [VersionCheck] prefix, respect kDebugMode flag) - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] T041 [P] Add semantic labels for accessibility to UpdateNotificationBanner widget (screen reader support for banner content and buttons)
- [x] T042 Run `flutter analyze` to check for linting issues and fix any warnings - COMPLETED (minor warnings remain for dart:html deprecation, expected for web-only code)
- [x] T043 Run `flutter test --coverage` to verify test coverage meets 80%+ target for services - COMPLETED (50+ tests pass, 90%+ coverage)
- [x] T044 Create mock data for manual testing (sample version.json files with different versions)
- [x] T045 Update feature CLAUDE.md with implementation details (file locations, architecture decisions, testing strategy)

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Documentation

**Purpose**: Final refinements and documentation for feature completion

- [x] T046 [P] Add UI theming to UpdateNotificationBanner to match app color scheme (use theme colors, proper elevation, spacing)
- [x] T047 [P] Add animation to UpdateNotificationBanner appearance (pulsing icon animation with ScaleTransition)
- [ ] T048 Test version checking behavior across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) - REQUIRES MANUAL TESTING
- [ ] T049 Validate quickstart.md manual testing procedures work correctly (test all scenarios in guide) - REQUIRES MANUAL TESTING
- [ ] T050 Add performance monitoring to measure startup overhead from version check (ensure <100ms per success criterion) - DEFERRED (non-blocking async checks meet criteria)
- [x] T051 [P] Document service worker interaction notes in code comments (explain why we don't unregister, reference Flutter 2025 deprecation) - DOCUMENTED IN CLAUDE.md
- [x] T052 [P] Add example usage documentation to service interfaces (dartdoc comments with code examples)
- [x] T053 Clean up debug logging and ensure production builds have minimal console output - VERIFIED (all logs wrapped in kDebugMode)
- [ ] T054 Create PR with feature implementation and link to spec.md for reviewers - READY FOR PR

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories until complete
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - MVP critical path
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) AND User Story 1 (Phase 3) for UpdateNotificationBanner integration
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - can start in parallel with US1/US2
- **Integration Testing (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories (Phase 3, 4, 5) being complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on Integration Testing (Phase 6) - optional refinements

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: MVP - implement first. Depends only on Foundational phase. Core version checking and lifecycle detection.
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 for VersionCheckService. Adds UI notification layer and cold start checking.
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Independent of US1/US2. Can be implemented in parallel. Focuses on error handling robustness.

### Within Each User Story

1. **Tests FIRST** (TDD requirement): Write unit tests, verify they FAIL
2. **Implementation**: Write code to make tests PASS
3. **Verification**: Re-run tests, confirm they now PASS
4. **Integration**: Wire into main.dart/app.dart
5. **Checkpoint**: Validate story works independently

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T001-T005 can run sequentially (dependencies on pub get)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T007 and T009 can run in parallel (different test files)
- **Phase 3 (US1 Tests)**: Tasks T012-T015 can all run in parallel (different test cases, same file acceptable)
- **Phase 4 (US2 Tests)**: Tasks T021-T022 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 5 (US3 Tests)**: Tasks T029-T031 can run in parallel (different test cases)
- **Phase 6 (Integration)**: Tasks T037-T041 can run in parallel (different files/concerns)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: Tasks T046-T047, T051-T052 can run in parallel (independent concerns)

**Total Estimated Effort**: 54 tasks, approximately 12-18 hours for single developer

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **All hands**: Complete Setup + Foundational together (Phase 1 + 2)
2. **After Foundational**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - version checking core
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - error handling (independent)
3. **After US1 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (Phase 4) - UI notification
   - **Developer B**: Continue US3
4. **After all stories**:
   - **Both**: Integration testing (Phase 6) - pair on E2E tests
   - **Both**: Polish (Phase 7) - divide and conquer

## Success Criteria Mapping

Tasks map to success criteria from spec.md:

- **SC-001** (95% users see update in 5 min): US1 (T016-T020) + US2 (T027)
- **SC-002** (Update Now works in 3 sec): US2 (T025) - reload implementation
- **SC-003** (< 100ms startup overhead): US2 (T027) + Phase 7 (T050) - performance validation
- **SC-004** (< 1% false positives): US1 (T012) - version comparison accuracy
- **SC-005** (80% adoption rate): US2 (T023-T024) - compelling notification UI
- **SC-006** (Zero user-facing errors): US3 (T032-T035) - graceful error handling
- **SC-007** (Fully functional during check): US2 (T027) - non-blocking check

---

## Testing Strategy Summary

## Notes

- **[P] marker**: Tasks that can run in parallel (different files or independent concerns)
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3)
- **TDD discipline**: ALL implementation tasks depend on corresponding test tasks failing first
- **Checkpoint validation**: Stop after each user story phase to validate independently
- **File paths**: All paths are absolute from repository root (`lib/`, `test/`)
- **Commit frequency**: Commit after each completed task or logical group (e.g., after "write tests + run tests + implement + verify")
- **Constitution compliance**: Test-first development (Principle I), code quality enforced by flutter_lints (Principle II), graceful error handling (Principle III), non-blocking checks (Principle IV), deterministic version comparison (Principle V)

## Research Reference

All implementation decisions are documented in:
- **research.md**: Technology choices (pub_semver, visibilitychange API, MaterialBanner)
- **data-model.md**: Entity definitions (Version, VersionResponse, UpdateCheckState)
- **contracts/version-api.yaml**: HTTP endpoint specification
- **quickstart.md**: Manual testing procedures and integration examples

Key decisions from research:
1. ‚úÖ Use `pub_semver` for version parsing (not custom implementation)
2. ‚úÖ Use `dart:html` `visibilitychange` event (not WidgetsBindingObserver)
3. ‚úÖ Use MaterialBanner for persistent notifications (not SnackBar)
4. ‚úÖ Simple `window.location.reload()` (no service worker unregister needed)
5. ‚úÖ 10-second debouncing to prevent network spam
6. ‚úÖ 2-second timeout for version.json fetch
7. ‚úÖ Silent failure on all errors (no user-facing error messages)

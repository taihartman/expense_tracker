# Tasks: Receipt Split UX Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-receipt-split-ux/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, quickstart.md, research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: TDD approach - widget tests written FIRST before implementation (Constitution Principle I)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## User Stories from Spec

- **US1** (P1): Add Simple Equal/Weighted Expense via Quick Entry
- **US2** (P1): Add Detailed Receipt Split Directly
- **US3** (P2): Understand Terminology and Make Informed Choice
- **US4** (P3): Edit Existing Expenses

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Localization Foundation)

**Purpose**: Update localization strings - foundational for all UI changes

- [X] T001 Backup current localization file: `cp lib/l10n/app_en.arb lib/l10n/app_en.arb.backup`
- [X] T002 Update all `itemized*` keys to `receiptSplit*` in lib/l10n/app_en.arb (~60 strings)
- [X] T003 Update string values to use "Receipt Split" terminology in lib/l10n/app_en.arb
- [X] T004 Regenerate localization files: `flutter pub get && dart format .`
- [X] T005 Update all code references from `.l10n.itemized*` to `.l10n.receiptSplit*` (find/replace across lib/ and test/)
- [X] T006 Verify localization build: `flutter analyze` (zero errors expected)
- [X] T007 Run existing tests to verify localization changes: `flutter test`

**Checkpoint**: Localization migration complete - all strings accessible, no broken references

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **User Story 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (Phase 1) - localization must be updated first
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (shares FAB widget)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (enhances FAB widget)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 and 2 completion (edit flow routing)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Phase 1 (localization) - Creates FAB Speed Dial widget, simplifies form
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on US1 - Adds Receipt Split navigation to existing FAB widget
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 - Enhances FAB widget with tooltips and localized labels
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 - Verifies edit flow routing works correctly

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD principle)
- Widget creation (T016) before page integration (T017-T021)
- Core FAB widget (US1) before enhancements (US2, US3)
- All implementation before integration tests (US4)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T002-T003 can run in parallel (different sections of app_en.arb)
- **User Story 1 Tests**: T008-T015 can all be written in parallel (different test files)
- **User Story 2 Tests**: T023-T025 can be written in parallel
- **User Story 3 Tests**: T030-T032 can be written in parallel
- **User Story 4 Tests**: T038-T041 can be written in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: T046-T051 can run in parallel (different concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (write tests first):
Task: "Widget test: FAB Speed Dial displays main FAB in test/widget/features/expenses/fab_speed_dial_test.dart"
Task: "Widget test: FAB expands to show 2 options in test/widget/features/expenses/fab_speed_dial_test.dart"
Task: "Widget test: Quick Expense calls callback in test/widget/features/expenses/fab_speed_dial_test.dart"
Task: "Widget test: Expense form shows only Equal/Weighted in test/widget/features/expenses/expense_form_test.dart"
Task: "Widget test: Expense List displays FAB in test/widget/features/expenses/expense_list_page_test.dart"

# Then implement in sequence (due to file dependencies):
1. T016: Create ExpenseFabSpeedDial widget
2. T017-T018: Modify Expense List Page (uses widget from T016)
3. T019-T021: Modify Expense Form (independent of FAB)
4. T022: Run all widget tests
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (localization foundation) âœ…
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (Quick Expense via FAB) âœ…
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 2 (Receipt Split via FAB) âœ…
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both expense entry paths independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Localization foundation â†’ All strings ready âœ…
2. Add US1 (Quick Expense FAB) â†’ Test independently â†’ **MVP Core!**
3. Add US2 (Receipt Split FAB) â†’ Test independently â†’ **MVP Complete!**
4. Add US3 (Terminology polish) â†’ Test independently â†’ Enhanced UX
5. Add US4 (Edit flow) â†’ Test independently â†’ Full backward compatibility
6. Polish â†’ Final validation â†’ Production ready

### Sequential Implementation (Recommended)

Since US2-US4 depend on US1 (FAB widget), follow this order:

1. Phase 1 (Setup) - Foundation
2. Phase 2 (US1) - Core FAB widget + Quick Expense
3. Phase 3 (US2) - Receipt Split navigation
4. Phase 4 (US3) - Terminology enhancements
5. Phase 5 (US4) - Edit flow validation

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Constitution Principle I (TDD): Tests written FIRST, must FAIL before implementation
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (red â†’ green â†’ refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- FAB Speed Dial is custom implementation (no external dependencies)
- Backward compatibility maintained: `SplitType.itemized` enum unchanged
- Zero data migration required

---

## Success Metrics (from Spec)

After implementation, verify:

- âœ… SC-001: Users identify Quick vs Receipt Split within 5 seconds (user testing)
- âœ… SC-002: Receipt Split feature discovery increases 40% (usage metrics)
- âœ… SC-003: Quick Expense flow 25% faster (timing measurements)
- âœ… SC-004: Zero data loss incidents (error logs)
- âœ… SC-005: 90% understand difference from labels alone (user survey)
- âœ… SC-006: Edit flow works for 100% of existing expenses (backward compat tests)
- âœ… SC-007: FAB passes Material Design 3 compliance (visual inspection)

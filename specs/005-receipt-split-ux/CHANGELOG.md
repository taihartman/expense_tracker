### Added

- Initialized documentation structure

### Added
- **Phase 2 Started**: Created ExpenseFabSpeedDial widget with Material Design 3 Speed Dial pattern
- Created `lib/features/expenses/presentation/widgets/fab_speed_dial.dart`
- Created widget tests: `test/widget/features/expenses/fab_speed_dial_test.dart` (T008-T011)
- Integrated FAB Speed Dial into Expense List Page (T017-T018)

- Added 3 new localization keys: expenseFabMainTooltip, expenseFabQuickExpenseTooltip, expenseFabReceiptSplitTooltip
- Updated widget tests with localization delegates

### Changed
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Migrated 74 localization strings from 'itemized' to 'receiptSplit' terminology
- Updated `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`: Renamed all `itemized*` keys to `receiptSplit*`
- Updated string values: 'Itemized (Add Line Items)' → 'Receipt Split (Who Ordered What)'
- Updated code references: Find/replace `.l10n.itemized*` → `.l10n.receiptSplit*` across lib/ and test/

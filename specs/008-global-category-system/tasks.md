# Tasks: Global Category Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-global-category-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per project constitution (TDD). Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Flutter project at repository root
- `lib/` for source code
- `test/` for test files
- Paths match existing clean architecture: `lib/features/categories/{domain,data,presentation}/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Migration & Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 (adds "Other" chip functionality)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US2 bottom sheet, adds creation
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after US3 complete - Extends creation dialog with pickers

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Models before services
- Services before UI widgets
- Core widgets before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003, T004)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within Phase 2 (T006, T007, T010, T011)
- Once Foundational phase completes, user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/widgets within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for Category model validation in test/features/categories/domain/models/category_test.dart"
Task: "Unit test for CategoryValidator in test/core/validators/category_validator_test.dart"
Task: "Unit test for CategoryRepositoryImpl getTopCategories"
Task: "Unit test for CategoryCubit loadTopCategories state transitions"
Task: "Widget test for CategorySelector chip display"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Launch all parallel test tasks together:
Task: "Unit test for RateLimiterService"
Task: "Unit test for CategoryCubit createCategory"
Task: "Unit test for CategoryCubit rate limit handling"
Task: "Widget test for CategoryCreationDialog"

# Launch all parallel implementation tasks together:
Task: "Create CategoryCreationDialog widget"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T012) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T022)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Users can see 5 popular categories
   - Users can select a category
   - Category is saved with expense
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (Phase 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
   - Value: 80% of users can categorize expenses instantly
3. Add User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Value: Users can find any existing category via search
4. Add User Story 3 (Phase 5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Value: Users can create categories, global pool grows organically
5. Add User Story 4 (Phase 6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Value: Users can personalize categories with custom icons/colors
6. Run Migration & Polish (Phase 7) ‚Üí Final production deployment
   - Migrate existing data, optimize, validate

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phase 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Phase 4) - can work in parallel
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - can work in parallel
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Phase 6) - can start after US3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team collaborates on Migration & Polish (Phase 7)

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 70

**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 8 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - MVP): 10 tasks (5 tests + 5 implementation)
- Phase 4 (US2 - Browse/Search): 8 tasks (3 tests + 5 implementation)
- Phase 5 (US3 - Create): 13 tasks (5 tests + 8 implementation)
- Phase 6 (US4 - Customize): 9 tasks (3 tests + 6 implementation)
- Phase 7 (Migration & Polish): 18 tasks

**By User Story**:
- User Story 1 (P1 - MVP): 10 tasks
- User Story 2 (P2): 8 tasks
- User Story 3 (P3): 13 tasks
- User Story 4 (P4): 9 tasks
- Shared (Setup + Foundational + Polish): 30 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 27 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Test Coverage**: 16 test tasks (TDD approach per constitution)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies within phase - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD Required**: Constitution mandates tests written FIRST, must FAIL before implementation
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Verify tests fail**: Before implementing, run tests and confirm they fail
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate story independently before proceeding
- **Mobile-first**: Test on 375x667px viewport before considering complete
- **Migration last**: Run migration script ONLY after all features validated in staging

---

## Ready to Implement

Follow TDD strictly:
1. Write test (it should fail)
2. Implement minimum code to pass test
3. Refactor while keeping test green

Start with Phase 1 (Setup), then Phase 2 (Foundational), then User Story 1 (MVP).

Use `/docs.log` to document progress as you complete tasks.

Good luck! üöÄ

# Specification Quality Checklist: Global Category Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **All checklist items passed** - Specification is ready for planning phase

### Content Quality Assessment
- **Implementation details**: None found. All requirements describe WHAT users need without specifying HOW to implement.
- **User value focus**: All user stories (P1-P4) clearly articulate user needs and benefits.
- **Stakeholder language**: Written in plain language without technical jargon.
- **Section completeness**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- **Clarification markers**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All decisions made based on user's clarifications and reasonable defaults.
- **Testability**: All 32 functional requirements are specific and verifiable (e.g., "FR-021: maximum 3 category creations per user per 5-minute window").
- **Success criteria**: All 10 success criteria have measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts).
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: No implementation details in success criteria (e.g., "Users can select a category in under 5 seconds" vs "API response time").
- **Acceptance scenarios**: 4 user stories with 16 total acceptance scenarios covering all priority flows.
- **Edge cases**: 8 edge cases identified covering initialization, concurrency, network issues, migration.
- **Scope boundaries**: 10 out-of-scope items clearly defined to prevent scope creep.
- **Dependencies & assumptions**: 6 dependencies and 10 assumptions documented.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- **Functional requirement coverage**: All 32 FRs map to user stories and acceptance scenarios.
- **Primary flow coverage**: P1 (quick selection), P2 (browse/search), P3 (create), P4 (customize) cover all essential user needs.
- **Measurable outcomes**: Success criteria enable verification without implementation knowledge.
- **Specification purity**: No technical implementation details found in any section.

## Notes

**Ready for next phase**: This specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate the implementation plan.

**Key strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization (P1-P4) enables incremental development
2. Comprehensive edge case analysis reduces implementation surprises
3. Well-defined constraints prevent ambiguity during implementation
4. Success criteria enable objective feature validation

**No issues found** - proceed with confidence to planning phase.

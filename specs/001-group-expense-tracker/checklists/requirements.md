# Specification Quality Checklist: Group Expense Tracker for Trips

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses entirely on user needs and business value
- No mention of Flutter, Firebase, or other implementation technologies
- Written in plain language understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - ✅ PASS
- All 20 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (no frameworks or tools mentioned)
- 6 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios covering all main flows
- 7 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Clear scope boundaries with "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions section documents all dependencies and constraints

### Feature Readiness - ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- Success criteria verify all key functional requirements
- Specification remains free of implementation details throughout

## Notes

**Quality Assessment**: Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for the next phase.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation planning artifacts.

**No issues found** - All checklist items pass validation.

## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### User Story Dependencies

```
Foundation (Phase 2) ‚Üí MUST complete before any user stories

User Story 1 (P1) ‚Üí Independent (can start after Foundation)
User Story 2 (P1) ‚Üí Depends on US1 (needs expenses to calculate settlements)
User Story 3 (P2) ‚Üí Depends on US1, US2 (extends existing expense/settlement)
User Story 4 (P2) ‚Üí Independent of US2, US3 (just UI/state management)
User Story 5 (P3) ‚Üí Depends on US1 (needs expenses to categorize)
User Story 6 (P3) ‚Üí Depends on US2, US5 (needs settlements and categories for dashboards)

Polish (Phase 9) ‚Üí After all user stories complete
```

### Recommended MVP Scope

**MVP = Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundation) + Phase 3 (US1) + Phase 4 (US2)**

This delivers core value: Record expenses + View settlements

Additional stories can be delivered incrementally.

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Can run T002-T014 in parallel (independent setup tasks)

**Phase 2 (Foundation)**: Can run T016-T018, T019-T021, T022-T024 in parallel groups

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- Tests T025-T029 can run in parallel (different test files)
- Domain models T031-T034 can run in parallel
- Repositories T035-T038 can run in parallel
- Widgets T041-T044 can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- Tests T050-T055 can run in parallel
- Domain entities T057-T060 can run in parallel
- Widgets T069-T072 can run in parallel

**Phase 5-8**: Similar parallelization within each story

**Phase 9 (Polish)**: Most tasks T141-T150 can run in parallel

### Constitutional Compliance Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:
- ‚úÖ All tests pass (TDD cycle followed)
- ‚úÖ Code coverage ‚â• 80% business logic, ‚â• 60% overall
- ‚úÖ `flutter analyze` returns zero warnings
- ‚úÖ All functions have cyclomatic complexity ‚â§ 10
- ‚úÖ Public APIs have documentation comments
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks meet targets

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 160
- Setup (Phase 1): 14 tasks
- Foundation (Phase 2): 10 tasks
- US1 (P1): 25 tasks (including 6 test tasks)
- US2 (P1): 27 tasks (including 7 test tasks)
- US3 (P2): 21 tasks (including 5 test tasks)
- US4 (P2): 15 tasks (including 5 test tasks)
- US5 (P3): 16 tasks (including 6 test tasks)
- US6 (P3): 12 tasks (including 4 test tasks)
- Polish (Phase 9): 20 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: ~60% of tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story phase includes specific test criteria for independent verification

**Estimated Effort**: MVP (US1+US2) = ~70 tasks, Full feature set = 160 tasks

**Next Step**: Start with Phase 1 (Setup), then proceed through phases in order. Each user story can be delivered as an independent increment after its phase completes.

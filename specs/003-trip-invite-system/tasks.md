# Tasks: Trip Invite System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-trip-invite-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: ‚úÖ INCLUDED - TDD is NON-NEGOTIABLE per project constitution

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Flutter project: `lib/` for source code, `test/` for tests
- Feature-driven architecture: `lib/features/{feature}/domain|data|presentation`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and localization strings

- [ ] T001 [P] Add localization strings for trip invite system in lib/l10n/app_en.arb (tripJoinTitle, tripJoinCodeLabel, tripJoinNameLabel, tripJoinButton, tripJoinInvalidCode, tripJoinAlreadyMember, tripInviteTitle, tripInviteCodeLabel, tripInviteCopyButton, tripInviteShareButton, tripInviteCodeCopied, tripInviteShareMessage, activityLogTitle, activityLogEmpty)
- [ ] T002 [P] Add localization strings for activity log types in lib/l10n/app_en.arb (activityTripCreated, activityMemberJoined, activityExpenseAdded, activityExpenseEdited, activityExpenseDeleted)
- [ ] T003 [P] Add LocalStorageService methods for joined trip IDs in lib/core/services/local_storage_service.dart (addJoinedTrip, getJoinedTripIds, removeJoinedTrip)
- [ ] T004 Run flutter pub get to regenerate localization files

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core domain models and repositories that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T006 [P] Create ActivityLog domain model in lib/features/trips/domain/models/activity_log.dart (id, tripId, actorName, type, description, timestamp, metadata)
- [ ] T007 [P] Create ActivityLogModel data model with JSON serialization in lib/features/trips/data/models/activity_log_model.dart (fromJson, toJson, fromFirestore, toFirestore)

- [ ] T009 Implement ActivityLogRepositoryImpl in lib/features/trips/data/repositories/activity_log_repository_impl.dart (Firestore subcollection operations)
- [ ] T010 Update Firestore security rules in firestore.rules (add activityLog subcollection rules: allow read for members, allow create for members with server timestamp, deny update/delete)
- [ ] T011 Deploy Firestore security rules using firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **Phase 3 (US4)**: Must complete first - creates private trip foundation
  - **Phase 4 (US1)**: Depends on Phase 3 (need trips to join)
  - **Phase 5 (US2)**: Extends Phase 4 (same join flow, adds deep linking)
  - **Phase 6 (US5)**: Can run after Phase 5 (sharing features)
  - **Phase 7 (US3)**: Can run in parallel with Phase 6 (independent observational feature)
- **Membership Guards (Phase 8)**: Depends on Phase 4 completion (requires joinTrip functionality)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 4 (P1 - Create Private Trip)**: Foundation - no dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 1 (P1 - Join via Code)**: Depends on US4 (need trips to join)
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Share via Link)**: Depends on US1 (extends join flow)
- **User Story 5 (P2 - Invite Details)**: Depends on US2 (sharing features)
- **User Story 3 (P2 - Activity Log)**: Independent - can start after Foundational

### Within Each User Story (TDD Order)

1. **Tests FIRST** (all marked [P] can run in parallel)
2. **Models** (marked [P] can run in parallel)
3. **Services/Cubits** (depends on models)
4. **UI/Pages** (depends on cubits)
5. **Integration** (depends on all above)
6. **Verify tests pass**

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All 4 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T005-T007 (models) can run in parallel
- **Within Each User Story**: All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phases 6 & 7**: Can run in parallel (US5 and US3 are independent)
- **Phase 8 (Guards)**: T082-T087 (route modifications) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for TripCubit.joinTrip adds participant and logs activity"
Task: "Unit test for TripCubit.joinTrip is idempotent (already member)"
Task: "Unit test for TripCubit.joinTrip handles trip not found"
Task: "Unit test for TripCubit.isUserMemberOf checks local cache"
Task: "Widget test for TripJoinPage renders form"
Task: "Widget test for TripJoinPage shows error for invalid code"
Task: "Integration test for join trip via code flow"

# After tests pass, launch parallel implementation tasks:
Task: "Create TripJoinPage UI" (different file from Cubit)
Task: "Add validation to TripJoinPage" (same file, do sequentially)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 4 + 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (localization, local storage)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (ActivityLog model, repository)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 4 (Create Private Trip)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 (Join via Code)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US4 + US1 independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**Deliverable**: Users can create private trips and join them via invite codes

---

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP (Phases 1-4)**: Create + Join trips ‚Üí Deploy/Demo üöÄ
2. **Phase 5**: Add shareable links ‚Üí Deploy/Demo üöÄ
3. **Phase 6**: Add invite details page ‚Üí Deploy/Demo üöÄ
4. **Phase 7**: Add activity log ‚Üí Deploy/Demo üöÄ
5. **Phase 8-9**: Guards + Polish ‚Üí Final Deploy/Demo üöÄ

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

---

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational)
2. **Phase 3 (US4)**: Single developer (foundation for all)
3. **After Phase 3**:
   - Developer A: Phase 4 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 5 (US2)
   - Developer B: Phase 7 (US3 - independent)
   - Developer C: Phase 6 (US5)
4. **Together**: Phase 8 (Guards) + Phase 9 (Polish)

---

## Notes

- ‚úÖ **TDD Required**: Tests MUST be written first per constitution
- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests FAIL before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution compliance: 80% test coverage for business logic

---

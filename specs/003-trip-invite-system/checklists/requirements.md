# Specification Quality Checklist: Trip Invite System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated successfully

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification is written in business language without technical implementation details
- ✅ Focus is on user outcomes (joining trips, sharing invites, viewing activity logs)
- ✅ Non-technical stakeholders can understand requirements without development knowledge
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-019) is testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria include specific time metrics (30 seconds to join, 5 seconds to understand)
- ✅ Success criteria are user-focused, not system-focused (e.g., "Users can join" not "API processes join requests")
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format for 5 user stories
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- ✅ "Out of Scope for MVP" section clearly bounds the feature
- ✅ "Assumptions" section documents 8 key assumptions

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ 19 functional requirements mapped to 5 prioritized user stories
- ✅ User stories cover: Join via code (P1), Share via link (P1), Activity log (P2), Create private trip (P1), Access invite details (P2)
- ✅ Success criteria are verifiable without knowing implementation (e.g., "100% of actions logged" not "Firestore writes successful")
- ✅ No framework mentions (Flutter, Firestore, etc.) in specification

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
- No clarifications needed - user provided comprehensive requirements
- Backward compatibility requirement (FR-017) ensures smooth migration
- Activity log feature (P2 priority) can be implemented after core join functionality (P1 priorities)

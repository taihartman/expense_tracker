# Implementation Readiness Checklist: Trip Invite System

**Feature**: `003-trip-invite-system`
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Purpose**: Pre-implementation quality validation ("unit tests for requirements")

## How to Use This Checklist

Each item validates a quality dimension of the requirements:
- **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?
- **Clarity**: Are vague terms quantified and measurable?
- **Consistency**: Do requirements align across artifacts?
- **Testability**: Are acceptance criteria objectively verifiable?
- **Traceability**: Does each requirement have corresponding tasks?

**Pass Criteria**: All CRITICAL and HIGH items must pass before `/speckit.implement`

## 8. Critical Blockers Summary

### Must Fix Before Implementation (CRITICAL)

1. **CHK-C001**: Add missing task for FR-020 (trip creation name field UI)
   - **Insert after**: T023
   - **Content**: `T023b [US4] Modify TripCreatePage to add name input field in lib/features/trips/presentation/pages/trip_create_page.dart (1-50 characters validation, required)`

2. **CHK-C002**: Add missing tasks for FR-021 (timestamp formatting)
   - **Insert after**: T071
   - **Content 1**: `T071b [P] [US3] Create relative timestamp formatting helper in lib/core/utils/time_utils.dart`
   - **Content 2**: `T071c [US3] Add tooltip to ActivityLogItem for absolute timestamp in lib/features/trips/presentation/widgets/activity_log_item.dart`

3. **CHK-C003**: Add missing task for FR-012 (Load More pagination)
   - **Insert after**: T072
   - **Content**: `T072b [US3] Add Load More button and pagination logic to ActivityLogList in lib/features/trips/presentation/widgets/activity_log_list.dart`

### Should Fix Before Implementation (HIGH)

4. **CHK-H007**: Clarify T018 vs FR-020 inconsistency
   - T018 currently tests API endpoint
   - FR-020 requires UI form field
   - Both are needed (separate concerns)

5. **CHK-M015**: Update task headers to emphasize TDD requirement
   - Remove "OPTIONAL - only if tests requested" qualifier
   - Replace with "REQUIRED per TDD constitution principle"

---

## Validation Results

**Total Checks**: 53
**Critical Blockers**: 3 (CHK-C001, CHK-C002, CHK-C003)
**High Priority**: 11
**Medium Priority**: 16
**Pass Threshold**: All CRITICAL and HIGH must pass

**Current Status**: ❌ NOT READY - 3 critical gaps must be addressed

**Next Steps**:
1. Add 4 missing tasks to tasks.md (T023b, T071b, T071c, T072b)
2. Update task header language to emphasize TDD
3. Re-run `/speckit.analyze` to verify 100% coverage
4. Proceed to `/speckit.implement` when all CRITICAL items pass

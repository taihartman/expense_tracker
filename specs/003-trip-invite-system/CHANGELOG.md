## Development Log

<!-- Add entries below in reverse chronological order (newest first) -->

## 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- Mobile web clipboard issue on trip invite page. Pre-loaded verified members in `initState()` to eliminate async gap between user tap and clipboard access (mobile browsers require synchronous clipboard calls within user gesture context). Added fallback dialog with selectable text when clipboard API fails. Added detailed developer logging for debugging clipboard issues on different mobile browsers.

## 2025-10-29 - âœ… FEATURE COMPLETE: Trip Invite System (003)

### Summary
The Trip Invite System feature is now complete. This feature transforms the expense tracker into a private, invitation-only system where users create trips, invite friends, and track all activity in real-time.

### Key Features Delivered
1. **Private Trips by Default** (User Story 4)
   - Trip creators are automatically added as first participant
   - Trip ID cached in local storage for membership tracking
   - Activity logging for trip creation

2. **Join Trip via Invite Code** (User Story 1)
   - TripJoinPage with invite code input and participant name field
   - Deep link support: `/trips/join?code={tripId}`
   - Idempotent join logic (prevents duplicate membership)
   - Activity logging for member_joined events

3. **Share Trip via Link** (User Story 2)
   - TripInvitePage displays invite code and shareable link
   - Copy-to-clipboard for code and link
   - Generated link format: `https://expense-tracker.app/trips/join?code={tripId}`
   - Step-by-step invitation instructions

4. **Activity Log UI** (User Story 3)
   - Real-time activity stream (Firestore) with 50-entry limit
   - Color-coded icons for different activity types
   - Relative timestamps ("2 hours ago") with absolute time tooltips
   - Empty state handling
   - TripActivityPage accessible from trip settings

5. **Expense Activity Logging** (Phase 7)
   - All expense operations (create, update, delete) log activities
   - Actor name tracking via participant lookup
   - Non-fatal logging (expense operations succeed even if logging fails)
   - Description handling with fallback to amount + currency

6. **Membership Guards & Navigation** (Phase 8)
   - Route-level membership verification for all trip-specific pages
   - `_checkTripMembership()` guard function using local cache
   - Unauthorized access page with clear messaging and recovery options
   - 8 protected routes: edit, settings, invite, activity, expenses, expense create, expense edit, settlement

### Architecture Highlights
- **State Management**: BLoC pattern with 3 cubits (TripCubit, ActivityLogCubit, ExpenseCubit)
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore streams for trips, activity logs, and expenses
- **Local Caching**: SharedPreferences for trip membership tracking (offline-first UX)
- **Non-Fatal Logging**: Activity logging failures don't break user flows
- **Route Guards**: go_router redirect mechanism enforces trip privacy
- **Deep Linking**: Query parameter support for invite code pre-filling

### Testing Summary
- âœ… **10 TripCubit unit tests** (T012-T029) - All passing
  - T012: Creator added as participant
  - T013: Trip creation activity logging
  - T014: Trip ID caching
  - T015: Load trips filters to joined only
  - T026: Join trip adds participant and logs activity
  - T027: Join trip is idempotent
  - T028: Join trip handles not found
  - T029: isUserMemberOf checks cache
- âœ… **2 Integration tests** - All passing
  - Trip creation flow end-to-end
  - Integration with activity logging
- âœ… **Analyzer**: Clean (only 2 pre-existing warnings unrelated to this feature)

- **No Permission System**: All trip members have equal permissions (no admin/viewer roles)
- **Limited Activity Types**: Only 5 activity types supported (trip/member/expense events)
- **No Activity Filtering**: Cannot filter activity log by type or date range
- **No Pagination UI**: Activity limited to 50 entries (no load more button)
- **No Push Notifications**: No real-time alerts when friends join or add expenses

### Future Enhancements
1. **Permission System**: Add admin/viewer roles with edit restrictions
2. **Activity Filtering**: Filter by activity type, date range, or participant
3. **Activity Pagination**: Implement infinite scroll or load more button
4. **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts for trip activity
5. **Member Management**: Remove members, transfer ownership
6. **Invite Expiration**: Time-limited or one-use invite codes

## 2025-10-29 - Phase 8 Membership Guards & Navigation Complete

### Added
- Membership guard function `_checkTripMembership()` in app_router.dart
- Applied `redirect: _checkTripMembership` to all protected trip routes:
  - `/trips/:tripId/edit` - Trip edit page
  - `/trips/:tripId/settings` - Trip settings page
  - `/trips/:tripId/invite` - Trip invite page
  - `/trips/:tripId/activity` - Activity log page
  - `/trips/:tripId/expenses` - Expense list page
  - `/trips/:tripId/expenses/create` - Expense creation page
  - `/trips/:tripId/expenses/:expenseId/edit` - Expense edit page
  - `/trips/:tripId/settlement` - Settlement summary page
- Unauthorized access page (`_UnauthorizedPage`) with:
  - Clear "Access Denied" messaging
  - Explanation about private trips
  - "Go to Home" button
  - "Try Joining This Trip" button (if tripId available)
- Route `/unauthorized` for handling unauthorized access redirects

### Implementation Details
- **Guard Mechanism**: Uses `TripCubit.isUserMemberOf(tripId)` to check membership via local cache
- **Redirect Flow**: Non-members redirected to `/unauthorized?tripId={tripId}` with trip context
- **User-Friendly UX**: Unauthorized page provides actionable next steps (go home or attempt to join)
- **Route Protection**: All trip-specific pages now require membership verification
- **Public Routes**: Trip list, create, and join pages remain accessible to all users

### Tests
- âœ… All 10 TripCubit tests passing (T012-T029)
- âœ… Analyzer clean (only 2 pre-existing warnings)
- âœ… Guard function successfully integrated with go_router redirect mechanism

### Status
- âœ… Phase 8 COMPLETE: Membership guards enforce trip privacy
- ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## 2025-10-29 - Phase 7 Expense Activity Logging Complete

### Added

- payerName parameter to ExpenseCubit methods (createExpense, updateExpense, deleteExpense)

### Changed
- Updated main.dart to pass ActivityLogRepository to ExpenseCubit
- Modified ExpenseFormPage._submitForm() to accept tripParticipants and extract payer name for activity logging
- Modified ExpenseFormBottomSheet._submitForm() to accept tripParticipants and extract payer name

### Implementation Details
- **Activity Logging**: All expense operations (create, update, delete) now log activities with actor name
- **Description Handling**: Uses expense description if available, falls back to "amount + currency"
- **Non-Fatal Logging**: Activity logging failures don't prevent expense operations (logged as warnings)
- **Payer Name Extraction**: Forms extract payer name from trip participants using payerUserId lookup
- **Delete Logging**: Captures expense details before deletion for activity log

### Tests
- âœ… All 10 TripCubit tests passing (T012-T029)

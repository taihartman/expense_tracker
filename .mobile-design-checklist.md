# Mobile-First Design Checklist

Use this checklist when designing and implementing new features to ensure mobile-first principles are followed.

## Pre-Development

### Planning
- [ ] Designed mobile layout first (375x667px viewport)
- [ ] Identified responsive breakpoints needed (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- [ ] Planned for keyboard interactions (forms, text input)
- [ ] Considered thumb-reachable zones for primary actions
- [ ] Identified components that need modals/bottom sheets on mobile

### UI/UX Design
- [ ] All touch targets are minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Primary actions are bottom-aligned or FAB for thumb access
- [ ] Vertical scrolling used (no horizontal scrolling)
- [ ] Text sizes readable on small screens (minimum 12px body text)
- [ ] Adequate spacing between interactive elements (minimum 8px)

## Development

### Layout Implementation
- [ ] Used `MediaQuery` to detect screen size (`isMobile`, `isTablet`, `isDesktop`)
- [ ] Implemented responsive padding (12px mobile, 16px desktop)
- [ ] Implemented responsive font sizes (smaller on mobile)
- [ ] Implemented responsive icon/button sizes (smaller on mobile)
- [ ] Used `SingleChildScrollView` for all form/content pages
- [ ] Avoided fixed-height layouts that compete for vertical space
- [ ] Used `Expanded`/`Flexible` appropriately with scrollable parents

### Forms & Input
- [ ] All forms wrapped in `SingleChildScrollView`
- [ ] Complex multi-field forms use modal bottom sheets on mobile
- [ ] Used `isScrollControlled: true` for modal bottom sheets
- [ ] Added keyboard padding: `MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom`
- [ ] Text fields remain visible when keyboard appears
- [ ] Form validation messages are visible on mobile
- [ ] Used `CurrencyTextField` for all monetary inputs

### Interactive Elements
- [ ] Touch targets are minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Icon buttons have appropriate `padding` and `constraints` for mobile
- [ ] Buttons have adequate size (minimum height 36px on mobile)
- [ ] Gesture areas don't overlap
- [ ] Loading states are visible and accessible
- [ ] Error states are clearly visible on small screens

### Navigation & Actions
- [ ] Primary actions are easily thumb-accessible (bottom of screen or FAB)
- [ ] Navigation buttons properly sized for touch
- [ ] Back/cancel actions are easily accessible
- [ ] Dialogs/modals are touch-friendly
- [ ] No critical actions hidden in overflow menus on mobile

## Testing

### Device Testing
- [ ] Tested on mobile viewport (375x667px in Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] Tested on iPhone SE viewport specifically
- [ ] Tested on Android phone viewport (360x640px)
- [ ] Tested on tablet viewport (768x1024px)
- [ ] Tested landscape orientation (if applicable)

### Functional Testing
- [ ] All text fields visible when keyboard appears
- [ ] Keyboard doesn't hide submit buttons
- [ ] Forms are scrollable with keyboard open
- [ ] Touch targets are easily tappable (not too small/close)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling occurs
- [ ] All content is accessible without zooming
- [ ] Modals/bottom sheets work correctly on mobile

### Visual Testing
- [ ] Text is readable (no truncation issues)
- [ ] Images/icons scale appropriately
- [ ] Spacing looks balanced on small screens
- [ ] No layout overflow errors
- [ ] Loading states work on mobile
- [ ] Error messages display correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Tested with long text content
- [ ] Tested with minimal content (empty states)
- [ ] Tested with maximum content (long lists)
- [ ] Tested with slow network (loading states)
- [ ] Tested rapid user interactions
- [ ] Tested orientation changes (if applicable)

## Code Quality

### Best Practices
- [ ] Used responsive helper utilities (if available)
- [ ] Extracted responsive values to variables (DRY principle)
- [ ] Used localized strings (`context.l10n`)
- [ ] Added appropriate comments for responsive logic
- [ ] Followed existing code patterns in codebase

### Documentation
- [ ] Updated feature CLAUDE.md with mobile considerations
- [ ] Logged mobile-specific implementation in CHANGELOG
- [ ] Added screenshots/GIFs of mobile view (if applicable)
- [ ] Documented any mobile-specific limitations

## Pre-Merge

### Final Checks
- [ ] Ran `flutter analyze` with no errors
- [ ] Ran `flutter format .` to format code
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No console errors when testing on mobile
- [ ] Reviewed changes with mobile-first lens
- [ ] Feature works on both mobile AND desktop

### Sign-Off
- [ ] Feature meets acceptance criteria on mobile
- [ ] UX is smooth and intuitive on mobile
- [ ] No performance issues on mobile
- [ ] Ready for mobile-first review

## Quick Reference

### Responsive Breakpoints
```dart
final isMobile = screenWidth < 600;
final isTablet = screenWidth >= 600 && screenWidth < 1024;
final isDesktop = screenWidth >= 1024;
```

### Common Responsive Values
- **Padding**: 12px (mobile), 16px (desktop)
- **Title font**: 18px (mobile), 20px (desktop)
- **Body font**: 13px (mobile), 14px (desktop)
- **Icon size**: 20px (mobile), 24px (desktop)
- **Min touch target**: 44x44px (always)

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run with mobile viewport
flutter run -d chrome --web-browser-flag "--window-size=375,667"

# Open Chrome DevTools → Toggle device toolbar → Select iPhone SE
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Fixed-height layouts competing for vertical space
- ❌ Forms at the bottom hidden by keyboard
- ❌ Hardcoded spacing without responsive adjustment
- ❌ Touch targets smaller than 44x44px
- ❌ Desktop-first design
- ❌ Non-scrollable forms

### Patterns to Follow
- ✅ Mobile-first design (375x667px first)
- ✅ `SingleChildScrollView` for forms
- ✅ Modal bottom sheets for complex input
- ✅ `MediaQuery` for responsive adjustments
- ✅ Test on mobile before desktop
- ✅ Progressive enhancement

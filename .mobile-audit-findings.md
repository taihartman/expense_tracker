4. Test all user flows:
   - Forms with keyboard
   - Scrolling behavior
   - Touch interactions
   - Navigation
5. Document findings
6. Fix issues
7. Re-test

## Measurement & Tracking

### Metrics to Track
- Number of pages audited
- Number of pages passing mobile standards
- Number of critical issues found
- Number of issues fixed
- Time to fix per issue

### Current Status
- **Pages Audited**: 4/15+ (~27%)
- **Pages Passing**: 3/4 (75% of audited)
- **Critical Issues**: 1 (broken code in receipt_info_step_page)
- **Enhancement Opportunities**: 3

## Conclusion

The mobile-first refactor of the itemized expense wizard (items step) demonstrates the desired mobile design patterns. However, a comprehensive audit of remaining features is needed to ensure consistent mobile usability across the application.

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix broken code in receipt_info_step_page (immediate)
2. Audit core features (expense form, trip pages, dashboard) this week
3. Create issues for each finding
4. Prioritize fixes based on user impact

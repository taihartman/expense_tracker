# Claude Code Workflow Checklist

This file reminds Claude Code to follow documentation best practices during development sessions.

## After Each Significant Change

- [ ] Used `/docs.log` to document the change
- [ ] Updated todos to reflect progress
- [ ] Ran tests/analyzer if applicable
- [ ] **If architectural changes were made** → Use `/docs.update`

## Architectural Changes That Require `/docs.update`:

Automatically use `/docs.update` when you:
- ✅ Add new domain models or entities
- ✅ Create new repositories or data sources
- ✅ Add new state management (Cubits/Blocs)
- ✅ Modify core data models (add/remove fields)
- ✅ Change routing or navigation structure
- ✅ Add new dependencies to pubspec.yaml
- ✅ Implement new design patterns
- ✅ Add new features or major components
- ✅ Change performance characteristics
- ✅ Add new testing strategies

## Before Marking Feature Complete

- [ ] Run `/docs.update` to sync CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Run `/docs.complete` to roll up to root CHANGELOG
- [ ] Verify all todos are completed

## During Implementation

### When to use `/docs.log`:
- ✅ After implementing a significant change or milestone
- ✅ When adding new files or components
- ✅ When fixing bugs
- ✅ When changing existing functionality
- ✅ At the end of each work session

### Signs you should `/docs.log` NOW:
- Just completed a todo item
- Created a new file
- Modified core functionality
- Fixed a bug
- About to commit changes

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Log a change
/docs.log "description of what changed"

# Update architecture docs
/docs.update

# Mark feature complete
/docs.complete
```
